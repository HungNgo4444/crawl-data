# Google News Scraper Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Comprehensive PRD for automated news collection system using Google News API with category management, PostgreSQL storage, and scheduling capabilities built on newspaper4k-master codebase.

## Document Overview

This PRD defines a production-ready Google News scraper system that automates news collection with intelligent categorization, robust scheduling, and scalable data management.

## PRD Sections

### [Goals and Background Context](./goals-and-background-context.md)

Defines project objectives for automated Google News crawling with category-based keyword search using OR logic. Covers system goals including real-time news data collection, PostgreSQL storage, scheduling automation, and integration with existing newspaper4k-master codebase.

### [Requirements](./requirements.md)

Complete functional and non-functional requirements specification. Details Google News API integration, category/keyword management with OR logic, article extraction using newspaper4k extractors, PostgreSQL storage schema, scheduling mechanisms, and performance/scalability constraints.

### [Technical Assumptions](./technical-assumptions.md)

Technical foundation and architecture decisions including monorepo structure, Python-based monolithic architecture with modular components, testing strategies, and technology stack choices (PostgreSQL, Celery/APScheduler, newspaper4k-master integration).

### [Epic List](./epic-list.md)

High-level epic breakdown organizing development into four major phases: Foundation & Core Infrastructure, Category & Keyword Management, Scheduling & Automation, and Data Management & Optimization.

### [Epic Details](./epic-details.md)

Detailed epic specifications with comprehensive user stories and acceptance criteria. Covers database schema design, newspaper4k integration, Google News crawling implementation, category CRUD operations, multi-keyword OR search, job scheduling, error handling, rate limiting, deduplication, performance monitoring, and data cleanup.

### [Next Steps](./next-steps.md)

Implementation guidance and architect prompt for creating technical architecture. Focuses on production-ready system design with newspaper4k-master integration, PostgreSQL optimization, Python scheduling solutions, error handling, and scalability considerations.
